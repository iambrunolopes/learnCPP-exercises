Define an enum (or enum class, if using a C++11 capable compiler) named Animal that contains the 
following animals: pig, chicken, goat, cat, dog, ostrich. Write a function named getAnimalName() that takes 
an Animal parameter and uses a switch statement to return the name for that animal as a std::string. Write 
another function named printNumberOfLegs() that uses a switch statement to print the number of legs each 
animal walks on. Make sure both functions have a default case that prints an error message. Call printNumberOfLegs() 
from main() with a cat and a chicken. Your output should look like this:

A cat has 4 legs.
A chicken has 2 legs.
