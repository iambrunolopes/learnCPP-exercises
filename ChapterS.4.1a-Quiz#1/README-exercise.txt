Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, the second larger than the first. 
If the user entered a smaller integer for the second integer, use a block and a temporary 
variable to swap the smaller and larger values. Then print the value of the smaller and larger variables. 
Add comments to your code indicating where each variable dies.
